# PlatePals

A fun website for license plate spotters! The goal of PlatePals is to give users a place to record unique license plates that they see during their days. Users can compete with others to have their name appear on the Competition page leaderboard or use PlatePals to keep a diary record of memories associated with seeing unique plates.

Users are asked to create a profile for the website. Once created, the user will be able to navigate the website pages.

## About 
Gives a brief overview of the website's goals and how to use it.

## Competition
Shows the top ranking users and their totals in three categories: "Most Plates Seen", "Most Recent Spottings", and "Most Seen State"

## Contact
A basic form for users to contact the website admin and leave a message

## Post
Users can record their plate spottings here. They will be given a form to fill out with three required inputs:
1. State license plate spotted
2. Where you spotted the plate
3. Date of Spotting
4. OPTIONAL: Comment - this gives users a chance to add a memory to the sighting such as "red porsche zooming down the highway"

Users can also edit and delete posts as needed.

## Profile
The profile page will be unqiue for each user. It will display their recent spottings and spotting statistics based on their posting history.
